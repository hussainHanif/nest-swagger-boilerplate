# .github/workflows
Here you can create and store yml files for each github action.

# lint.yml
Github action to run and show linter errors on each Pull request, by default it scans every pull request and push to main, develop or master branches.

# .husky
Folder which stores github hooks, by default it contains pre-commit hook which prevents push without fixing linter errors.

# .vscode

Documentation config and destination folder See VuePress doc for more

# src
Where we keep all our source files.

# common
Where we keep common typescript files, e.g. constants and DTOs.

# database
Folder to store files which are connected only to database.

# migrations
Folder to store application migrations which will be generated by typeorm.

# factories
Factories are used to create entities which will be used in seeds.

# seeds

# decorators

# filters
In this folder you can find app level filters.

# guards
You can store all guards here.

# i18n
Internalization JSON files are storied here.

# interceptors
Where we are keep interceptors.

# interfaces

# providers
These are utility functions you may want to share between many files in your application. They will always be pure and never have side effects, meaning if you provide a function the same arguments, it will always return the same result.

# shared
Shared module with global singleton services.

# modules
Where all our NestJS modules lives. See NestJS modules documentation for more.

# app.module.ts
The root application module.

# boilerplate.polyfill.ts
We extend built in classes so you can use helper function anywhere.

const users: UserEntity[] = ...;

const userDtos = users.toDtos();
# snake-naming.strategy.ts
We are using snake naming strategy for typeorm, so when you will generate migration it automatically will set snake_case column name from entity fields.

# tests
Folder where we keep all our e2e test files.

# .dockerignore
List a files which will be ignored during the docker build.

# .env
Environment variables which will load before app start and will be stored in process.env, (*) is a env name (development, test, staging, production)

# .eslintrc.js
Eslint configuration file, See the eslint doc for more.

# docker-compose.yml
Docker compose configuration file, See the docker docs for more.

# Dockerfile
basic Dockerfile configuration to build the app, See the docker docs for more.

# ormconfig.ts
Typeorm configuration file which is used for migrations and seeds.
